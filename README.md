Exercise 2 : Unity Project

I felt like it would be a good feature to be able to pause the game, so I added it. Game can be paused and unpaused with key P.
I did not really have a good idea to make the obstacles spawn in some specific patterns, so I improved the gameplay differently. The in-game level speed increases exponentially depending on the current score, so over time it is kinda difficult to even react. I really like ultra hardcore games, so I set it up that hard on purpose.

My record is 65, what's yours?
